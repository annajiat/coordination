# HPC Carpentry: Introducing New Users to HPC

Contributors: Alim Rasel, Keller, O'Cais, Reid

Reviewers considered seven categories on a scale from zero to three.
(absolutely not, unlikely, probably so, definitely so).

1. Are the **goals**, topic & format clearly articulated?
2. Is the **scope** aligned with SC (HPC, networking, storage)?
3. Is the projected audience **inter**activity adequate, appropriate
   & believable?
4. Is it expected to **build** the community of interest?
5. Is it likely to **draw** the projected audience size?
6. Is the allocated **time** sufficient?
7. What is the reviewer's **expert**ise in the subject area?
8. **Rec**ommendation

## Full Reviews

### Reviewer 1

#### Strengths

The topic for this BoF is of great importance. That is, educating HPC
developers and users. The proposal supports the decision of the HPC
Carpentry environment.

#### Weaknesses

It is narrowly focused on a single environment. Maybe this one is the
best, but I doubt it. The abstract makes the BoF sound like an
advertisement for their lesson environment.

There are too many questions that they want to present during the
session.
  
#### Comments

This proposal sounds like an advertisement for the HPC Carpentry
environment. You should focus on what you provide and ask the
audience for input on how to make it better. There are too many
questions.

### Reviewer 2

#### Strengths

* Wide education efforts in HPC, such as those on the Carpentries
  model, are encouraging.
* The SC audience seems ripe for 'trainers' in the HPC community.

#### Weaknesses

* Some topics depend on previous experience using HPC Carpentry
  material.
* Six topics to cover may be overwhelming for 90 minutes and 75%
  audience participation expectation.

#### Comments

Will attendees that have not used HPC carpentry's material be able to
benefit from the BoF discussion?

### Reviewer 3

#### Strengths

This BOF represents the HPC Carpentry community that provides HPC
lessons to new users. They will discuss pain points and further
refinement of the material developed and ask what new material should
be developed. Supporting new users with material like this is
important, equally important is to evaluate the usefulness and
effectiveness of this material. This BOF will be soliciting feedback
on their helpfulness of their HPC lessons. I think this is important
and very appropriate for SC attendees.

#### Weaknesses

Session format could have been more explicit in terms of presentation
time to discussions time.

#### Comments

I would have more planned structure to the agenda, allowing for
flexibility during the BOF.

### Reviewer 4

#### Strengths

* Good community service effort.
* BOF important for getting feedback and prioritizing the roadmap.

#### Weaknesses

HPC Carpentry groups seems not to have been present at HPC in recent
past (last BOF at SC'17) -- raises some concerns about current
visibility and ability to bring together relevant stakeholders.

#### Comments

The BOF tackles an important goal of helping the HPC user community.
  
While the organizers are affiliated with the HPC Carpentry effort, it
is not clear that they are planning to reach out to the right set of
stakeholders to solicit the right feedback that the BOF is aimed to
provide.
