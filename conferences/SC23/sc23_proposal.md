#### Abstract

The HPC Carpentry project is a community-based organization with a set of lessons for introducing novice users from diverse communities to high-performance computing resources, including queuing systems, shared filesystems, and understanding scaling in parallel processing. Following the pedagogical model of The Carpentries, our material is presented in a workshop setting where learners type along with instructors to build deep understanding and muscle memory for introductory HPC cluster usage tasks. We have recently developed a two-day workshop, and are seeking feedback from the broader HPC user and administrator community with regard to future directions for the project.


#### Long Description

The HPC Carpentry initiative is community-based project that relies on volunteers to create, manage and deliver a set of instructional materials for novice users of HPC systems from a wide variety of backgrounds. As HPC resources become more widely available, a skills gap has opened up, where many projects that can now afford access to HPC systems are not able to use them effectively. HPC systems depend very strongly on legacy interfaces to computing, such as command-line interfaces and batch scripting, which may not be familiar to even expert computational scientists in the desktop application world.

Our materials and organization meet this need through the pedagogical techniques of the Carpentries community, which has had considerable success teaching Unix shell and introductory Python and Git in a workshop setting, where learners code along in real-time with instructors. The workshop setting provides a rich educational experience in a relatively short amount of time, and the interactive approach helps learners build up muscle memory for the tasks involved. Learners cannot be made into experts in the workshop time frame, but can get a feel for how the material being taught is supposed to work. Following the Carpentries example, our lessons are open-source, and we collect pre- and post-workshop information from instructors and learners to help execute continuous improvement on the material.

Our relationship with the Carpentries is not purely one of emulation -- we have recently entered incubator status with the Carpentries, and are working towards becoming an official lesson plan, alongside the existing Sofware, Data, and Library Carpentries.

For the BoF, we are hoping to raise awareness of our efforts within the HPC community, to solicit feedback from HPC users at all levels, as well as HPC administrators, on how we can engage with the greater community, by making future materials more relevant to the community's needs, and by enlarging the HPC Carpentry community to include more contributors and instructors from the broader HPC world to support a truly scalable apporach to HPC training.

#### Format Information

We propose to run the BoF in two parts. The first part will be a brief introduction to the project and its relationship to the Carpentries, an outline of our current materials, and our strategic plan. The second part will be an audience discussion section, where the session leaders will pose questions about the HPC community's needs for eductional content and solicit audience feedback to help us set future priorities.
