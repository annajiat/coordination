#### Abstract

The HPC Carpentry project is a community-based organization with a set of lessons for introducing novice users from diverse communities to high-performance computing resources, including queuing systems, shared filesystems, and understanding scaling in parallel processing. Following the pedagogical model of The Carpentries, our material is presented in a workshop setting where learners type along with instructors to build deep understanding and muscle memory for introductory HPC cluster usage tasks. We have recently developed a two-day workshop, and are seeking feedback from the broader HPC user and administrator community with regard to future directions for the project.


#### Long Description

The HPC Carpentry initiative is a community-based project that relies on volunteers to create, manage and deliver a set of instructional materials for novice users of HPC systems from a wide variety of backgrounds. As HPC resources become more widely available, a skills gap has opened up, where many projects that can now afford access to HPC systems are not able to use them effectively. HPC systems depend very strongly on legacy interfaces to computing, such as command-line interfaces and batch scripting, which may not be familiar to even expert computational scientists in the desktop application world.

Our materials and organization meet this need through the pedagogical techniques of The Carpentries, which has had considerable success teaching Unix shell and introductory Python and Git in a workshop setting, where learners code along in real-time with instructors. The workshop setting provides a rich educational experience in a relatively short amount of time, and the interactive approach helps learners build up muscle memory for the tasks involved. Learners cannot be made into experts in the workshop time frame, but can get a feel for how the material being taught is supposed to work. Following the Carpentries example, our lessons are open-source, and we collect pre- and post-workshop information from instructors and learners to help execute continuous improvement on the material. 

Our relationship with the Carpentries is not purely one of emulation -- we are working towards becoming an official lesson program, alongside the existing Software, Data, and Library Carpentries, and our lessons have recently entered incubator status. We are also aligned with the Carpentries' commitment to a positive learning environment that is respectful of learners and contributors from many backgrounds and parts of the world.

We had an SC21 BoF which was focused on community feedback with regard to our curriculum priorities, which we have used to develop our current workshop outline. Entering incubator status with the Carpentries provides us with greater visibility, and presents challenges associated with teaching a single curriculum relevant to the wide range of different HPC architectures that exist in the world. Engaging with this challenge involves running our workshops and beginning the process of refining the lessons in response to actual instructor and learner experience. The HPC Carpentry developer community is not well positioned to do this directly, so for the this BoF, we are looking to illustrate the value of our content and organization, and build the community of instructors and contributors.

#### Format Information

We propose to run the BoF in two parts. The first part will be a brief introduction to the project, its relationship to the Carpentries, the Carpentries live-coding pedagogical technique, and the mechanics of setting up a workshop for a particular HPC resource. The second part will be an audience discussion section, where the session leaders will pose questions about the HPC community's needs for workshop support, and solicit community feedback to help ensure workshops are practical to prepare for people outside the HPC Carpentry development team.
