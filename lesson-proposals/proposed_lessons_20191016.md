These were proposed lessons by Andy Turner as posted in Issue #8

Lesson development and plans beyond hpc-shell and hpc-intro. I have a few ideas in the pipeline. Is anyone interested in these? Does anyone think they are particularly good or bad ideas?:

* hpc-parallel: introduce concepts around parallelisation - mainly as a support to follow-on linked lessons. Introduce concepts required for researchers to become better at exploiting HPC for their research: processes/threads, basic benchmarking, parallel implementation (Dask, GNU parallel, MPI, OpenMP, array jobs).
   - I do wonder if there are two courses here, rather than one but not sure how to split?
   - I think @psteinb has already done some work on lessons including Dask
* hpc- (where is a particular HPC software package, e.g. VASP, OpenFOAM, LAMMPS): how to use this particular software effectively on HPC systems, common pitfalls, building HPC into the research workflow, where to get help.
* hpc-ml (more speculative): Using machine learning frameworks effectively on HPC systems. Differences from running locally.
* hpc-singularity (more speculative): Using Singularity containers for HPC work.
