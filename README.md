# Coordinating HPC Carpentry

This repository serves as a centralizing location for documents / notes / information re: HPC Carpentry 
[HPC Carpentry organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry) that isn't contained on the general website. 

## Current status of HPC Carpentry

"Beta" lessons are available in the [HPC Carpentry Github organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry).

Anyone is welcome to use and modify these materials.  If you want to run a workshop called "HPC Carpentry" 
please see the suggested guidelines on the [HPC Carpentry about page](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/about). 

Anyone is welcome to submit pull requests modifying the current lessons.

If you're interested in becoming a lesson maintainer (reviewing issues and pull requests on the lesson material 
repositories), open an issue on the relevant lesson repository.  

Because we're a very loosely defined "organization" we don't have clear pathways for "joining" right now -- the main opportunities to get involved are (as described above) using the current lessons to teach, or contributing to the current lessons, or, as described below, 
staying connected to discussions about HPC Carpentry.  

We're trying to work out a process where decisions are made about what happens next with the lessons or the community in general.  Staying on the [discussion list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-hpc)
is the best way to stay connected to that process.  We are also having a [community call in December](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/1).

## Open Issues

* Starting a monthly meeting for people to chat, ask questions, discuss what's happening with HPC Carpentry; 
notes will probably be in this repository. 
* Creating/clarifying pathways for being involved.
* Incorporating the "templating" in @psteinb's fork to make it easy to switch schedulers (start w/ 2-3 for default)
* Adding new lessons (what process / how are they included)
* Confirm/finalize process for adding lesson maintainers
