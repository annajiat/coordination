# Coordinating HPC Carpentry

This repository serves as a centralizing location for documents, notes, and information regarding
the [HPC Carpentry organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry) that isn't contained on the
[general website](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/).

## Current status of HPC Carpentry

"Alpha" lessons are available in the [HPC Carpentry organization](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry).

Anyone is welcome to use and modify these materials. If you want to run a workshop called "HPC
Carpentry" please see the suggested guidelines on the [HPC Carpentry about
page](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/about).

Anyone is welcome to submit pull requests modifying the current lessons.

If you're interested in becoming a lesson maintainer (reviewing issues and pull requests on the
lesson material repositories), open an issue on the relevant lesson repository, or reach out to any
of the [current members](https://github.com/orgs/hpc-carpentry/people). "Joining" our organization
is an informal process at this stage, with as much or as little commitment as you choose to
provide. You are required to understand and comply with The Carpentries' [Code of Conduct](
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-summary-view)

The main opportunities to get involved are (as described above) using the current lessons to teach,
or contributing to the current lessons, and staying connected to discussions about HPC Carpentry
through our [discussion list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss-hpc).

After several years of collecting and curating HPC lesson materials, we are making a big push for
formal induction into The Carpentries, with primary emphasis on [HPC Intro](
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/hpc-intro). To that end, we have created a [Task Force](
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/12) that will meet regularly for discussions
and co-working hours. If you are interested in helping us to achieve this ambitious goal, please
join the [maintainers' list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/maintainers-hpc).

Please check the [Blog](https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/blog/) on the HPC Carpentry website for
related news and information.
